# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! I'm building this with [Astro](https://astro.build/) to document my journey learning programming.

## What I'll be writing about

I plan to share:
- Things I learn about JavaScript, React, and other web technologies.
- Snippets of code I find useful.
- Challenges I face and how I solve them.

Stay tuned for more updates!
