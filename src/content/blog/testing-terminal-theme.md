Welcome to the **Terminal Theme**. This post serves as a test pattern to ensure all typography and syntax highlighting is rendering correctly in our new `vim`-inspired environment.

## Typography Check

This theme uses **JetBrains Mono** for a consistent, developer-focused aesthetic. Whether you're reading a paragraph or scanning code, everything should feel like it belongs in an IDE.

### Lists

Here is an unordered list of features:
- Dark mode by default
- Monospaced fonts
- Syntax highlighting
- Vim status bars

And an ordered list for procedures:
1. Initialize repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Deploy to production

## Code Syntax Highlighting

The most important part of a dev blog is how it handles code. Let's test a JavaScript snippet:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  const greeting = "Hello, World!";
  console.log(greeting);
  
  return {
    status: 200,
    message: "System operational"
  };
}

// Execute
helloWorld();
```

## Blockquotes

## Tables

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `git status` | Show the working tree status |
| `git diff` | Show changes between commits |
| `git commit` | Record changes to the repository |

## Conclusion

If you can read this clearly and the colors look like a cool hacker movie, the theme is working as intended. `EOF`
